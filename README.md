# Enhancing-Fire-and-Smoke-Detection-Systems-Using-Transfer-Learning
This project improves fire and smoke detection using transfer learning with pre-trained CNN (ResNet50) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models. ViT achieved 97% accuracy, while ResNet50 offered faster real-time detection, balancing accuracy and speed for effective fire detection systems.
